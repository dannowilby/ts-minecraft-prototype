This project is made for two purposes. The first is to function as my assignment for my computer graphics course. That means that, above all else in the beginning, a simple game to navigate around a randomly generated voxel maze. The second is to make a minecraft clone that has a more real-to-life simulation of fluids. This will be the prototype to another minecraft clone written in a compiled language.
