# ts-minecraft-prototype

I originally made this project to create a minecraft clone which could simulate fluids through way of cellular automata. Ultimately the engine code got too messy/complex for the goal to be done in a reasonable amount of time. I'll probably attempt this again, but I'll use an engine so I can focus on the implementation rather than the boilerplate.

The engine is a rudimentary ECS system. The code for the prototype is in the example folder.

The branch assignment-4-lighting was a submission for an assignent I had in my computer graphics course. It used a much less developed version of the code in the master branch.

The texture atlas I used for the blocks is taken from [The Painterly Pack](http://painterlypack.net/).
